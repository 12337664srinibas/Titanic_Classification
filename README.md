#Titanic Classification Project

1. Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc. The goal is to use classification algorithms to determine which passengers are more likely to survive the disaster.

2. Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as:

Passenger ID
Passenger Class (Pclass)
Name
Gender (Sex)
Age
Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
Ticket
Fare
Cabin
Embarked (Port of Embarkation)
Survived (Target variable)
You can find the dataset here from the Kaggle competition.


4. Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc. (specified in requirements.txt)
Installation
To install the required packages, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
Data Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset for training.

bash
Copy code
python src/preprocessing.py
Training the Model: Use the training script to build and train the classification model.

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
Making Predictions: After training, use the predict.py script to make predictions on the test data.

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py
Jupyter Notebooks
You can also explore the project interactively through the Jupyter notebooks located in the notebooks directory. These include:

EDA.ipynb: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
model.ipynb: Train and evaluate the classification model.
5. Models and Evaluation
Several machine learning models were considered for this classification problem:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC metrics. The final model was saved as model.pkl.

6. Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.
The confusion matrix and ROC curve show good separation between the classes.
7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for binary classification. Through feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation, we were able to achieve reasonable accuracy in predicting Titanic survivors.
